# Creating Stories for Datashare's Components

Datashare's stories are used to document and test components effectively. These stories are located in the `src/stories` folder and are integral to generating the Storybook documentation.

You can view the new design on Figma: [Datashare Design](https://www.figma.com/design/zuUb7ndAVzky62jhRP1edJ/Datashare).

## Phase One: Presentation Components

In the first phase, we will focus on building the core of the design system, specifically presentation components that are simple or composite and free of dependencies such as routing or state management.

### Storybook for Presentation Components

- **Presentation Components**: Storybook excels at documenting and testing presentation components (also known as "dumb" or "pure" components). These components are solely responsible for displaying UI elements and do not contain any business logic or state management. They receive data and callbacks through props and render accordingly.

- **Isolation**: By isolating presentation components, Storybook helps avoid dependencies and side effects, providing a clear, visual way to test component displays. This isolation is beneficial for creating robust and reusable components.

### Separation of Concerns

To prevent components from becoming too complex, it's best to separate concerns by creating distinct components for presentation and behavior.

- **Presentation Components**: Handle the UI and are tested with stories in Storybook.
- **Behavior Components**: Manage logic and state, and are tested with unit tests.

### Testing Strategies

- **Presentation Components**: Test with stories in Storybook. This approach simplifies visual testing of components, including accessibility properties and snapshot testing.
- **Behavior Components**: Test with unit tests. This ensures logic and state management are verified independently.

## Project Structure

The project follows this structure:

```sh
datashare-client/
├── .storybook/
│   ├── main.js
│   └── preview.js
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── YourComponent.vue
│   │   └── YourOtherComponent
│   │         ├── YourOtherComponent.vue
│   │         ├── YourOtherComponentEntry.vue
│   │         └── YourOtherComponentHeader.vue
│   ├── stories/
│   │   ├── YourComponent.stories.js
│   │   └── YourOtherComponent
│   │         ├── YourOtherComponent.stories.vue
│   │         ├── YourOtherComponentEntry.stories.vue
│   │         └── YourOtherComponentHeader.stories.vue
│   └── main.js
└── package.json
```

## Story Example

### Component File

```vue
// src/components/YourComponent.vue
<template>
  <div class="your-component">
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'YourComponent',
  props: {
    title: {
      type: String,
      default: 'Hello, Storybook!',
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

### Story File

```js
// src/stories/YourComponent.stories.js
import YourComponent from '../components/YourComponent.vue';

export default {
  title: 'Datashare/YourComponent',
  component: YourComponent,
  argTypes: {
    title: { control: 'text' },
  },
};

const Template = (args, { argTypes }) => ({
  props: Object.keys(argTypes),
  components: { YourComponent },
  template: '<your-component v-bind="$props" />',
});

export const Default = Template.bind({});
Default.args = {
  title: 'Hello, Storybook!',
};

export const CustomTitle = Template.bind({});
CustomTitle.args = {
  title: 'Custom Title',
};
```

This structured approach ensures clarity and maintainability, facilitating a smooth development and testing process for the Datashare components.
