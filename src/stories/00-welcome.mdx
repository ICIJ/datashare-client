# Datashare Design System <span class="badge rounded-pill text-bg-action translate-middle-y">{pkg.version}</span>

Welcome to the Datashare Documentation, your central resource for building and extending the Datashare client.

<img class="img-thumbnail mb-3" src={searchListImg} alt="Search preview" />

This documentation acts both as a Design System and a Plugin Development Reference. It provides a comprehensive 
catalog of all available UI components, including their props and usage patterns, to help ensure consistency 
and reusability across the Datashare interface.

For developers building custom plugins, this site also serves as a complete reference. Youâ€™ll find:

* The [Core API](/?path=/docs/core-api--docs) page, which lists all methods and properties exposed on the Core class (accessible via window.datashare).
* The [Plugin Hooks](/?path=/docs/plugin-hooks--docs) page, which describes strategic hook points where your Vue components can be mounted.
* The [Insight Widgets](/?path=/docs/insights-widgets--docs) page, which documents the configurable widgets used to build project insights pages.
