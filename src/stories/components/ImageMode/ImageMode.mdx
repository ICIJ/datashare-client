# ImageMode

`ImageMode` component helps you do use image in different color modes. It must be used in
combination with `ImageModeSource` to explicitely define different images for each color mode. By
default Bootstrap comes with a build-in dark mode but this component is not limited to the
2 default color modes. You can define as many image variant as you want.

For instance:

```html
<image-mode image-class="rounded-5 img-fluid shadow">
  <image-mode-source src="https://placehold.co/300x200/2f2e41/949fb6?text=dark&font=playfair-display" color-mode="dark" />
  <image-mode-source src="https://placehold.co/300x200/F3F5F8/112A5C?text=light&font=playfair-display" />
</image-mode>
```

Will result to (try to switch theme in the toolbar):

<Canvas of={ImageMode.Default} sourceState='none' />

This component is mindfull of the current component's parent and therefore, will use the color mode of
the closest parent that uses the `data-bs-theme` attribute. If the parent's color mode changes, the
image will be updated reactivly using the [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver).

<Canvas of={ImageMode.LocalTheme} sourceState='none' />
