# Core API

This API provides access to a wide range of methods that allow plugins to interact with the Datashare client. It is
exposed as an instance of the Core class, available globally via `window.datashare` (or simply `datashare`). This API is
primarily intended for use in plugin development, offering convenient ways to manipulate widgets, respond to route
changes, access project data, register hooks, and more. 

This page is auto-generated from JSDoc and is intended as a reference for developers building Datashare plugins. 
You'll find detailed information about each method and property, including parameters, return types, and usage
notes.

**Example**

```js
datashare.replaceWidget('default-text', {
  card: true,
  cols: 6,
  type: 'WidgetText',
  content: "Welcome to my amazing project dashboard!",
  title: "Secret Project",
  order: "-1"
})
```
