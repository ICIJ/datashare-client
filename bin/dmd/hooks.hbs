# Plugin hooks

Plugin Hooks allow developers to extend the Datashare interface by injecting custom Vue components at predefined points
in the UI. These hooks act as strategic markers placed throughout the application where plugins can register new
functionality or visuals. This page provides a comprehensive list of available hooks, along with their locations, making
it easier for you to integrate your own components seamlessly into the Datashare experience.

## Hooks locations

| Component | Name |
| --- | --- |
{{#each hooks}}
  {{#with this}}
| [{{component}}]({{source}}) | `{{hook}}` |
  {{/with}}
{{/each}}
