# Insight widgets 

Insight Widgets are modular, reusable components designed to power a project's Insights page. Each widget serves a
specific purpose (whether it's visualizing metrics, surfacing key metadata, or highlighting user activity) and can be
configured independently to fit the needs of your project. By combining multiple widgets, you can build a customized,
dynamic dashboard that helps users make sense of the data at a glance. This page provides an overview of available
widgets and configuration options to help you get started.
