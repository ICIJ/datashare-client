To allow external developers to add their own components, we added markers
called "hooks" in strategic locations on the user interface  where a user can
define new Vue Component.

## Hooks locations

| Component | Name |
| --- | --- |
{{#each hooks}}
  {{#with this}}
| [{{path}}]({{wikiPath}}) â€” [source]({{href}}) | `{{hook}}` |
  {{/with}}
{{/each}}
