# Add plugins and extensions

**Plugins** are small programs that you can add to Datashare's **front-end** to get new features \(the front-end is the interface, "_the part of the software with which the user interacts directly_" - [source](https://languages.oup.com/)\).

**Extensions** are small programs that you can add to Datashare's **back-end** to add new features \(the back-end is "_the part of the software that is not directly accessed by the user, typically responsible for storing and manipulating data_" - [source](https://languages.oup.com/)\).

## Add plugins to Datashare \(front-end\)

**Restart Datashare to see your new extension activated in Datashare.**

## Update plugin or extension with latest version

When a newer version of a plugin or extension is available, you can click on the "**Update**" button to get the latest version. 

After that, if it is a plugin, **refresh** your page to activate the latest version. 

If it is an extension, **restart** Datashare to activate the latest version.
