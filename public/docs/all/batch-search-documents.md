# Batch search documents

### Prepare your batch search

* Write your queries, one per line, in the first column of a spreadsheet \(Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers, etc.\). In the example below, there are 4 queries:

**Search operators do NOT work in batch searches**: any space in your query is considered as a 'OR'. It means that if you write 'Hello world', the search engine of batch searches will look for documents which contain either 'hello' or 'world' or the two words. If you write 'Hello AND world NOT car', it will look for documents which contain either 'hello' or 'and' or 'world' or 'not' or 'car'.

* Export your spreadsheet in a CSV format:
