6. When you restart, another application will automatically open: Docker Desktop with its little whale icon. It will be visible on your Windows' menu bar, at the bottom right of your computer screen. It contains components necessary to have Datashare work. Docker Desktop will automatically be running when you use Datashare. You don't need an I.D. for this. To close this window, **click on the white 'x' on the right side of the red background.**
