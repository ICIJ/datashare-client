# List of common errors leading to "failure" in Batch Searches

## SearchException: query='AND ada' 

**One or several of your queries contains syntax errors**. 

It means that you wrote one or more of your queries the wrong way with some characters that are reserved as operators: [**read the list of syntax errors by clicking here**](https://icij.gitbook.io/datashare/all/batch-search-documents#i-get-a-failure-what-does-that-mean). 

**You need to correct the error\(s\) in your CSV** and re-launch your new batch search with a CSV that does not contain errors. [Click here to learn how to launch a batch search](https://icij.gitbook.io/datashare/all/batch-search-documents).

Datashare **stops at the first syntax error**. It reports only the first â€‹error. You might need to **check all your queries** as some errors can remain after correcting the first one.

Example of a syntax error message:

## elasticsearch: Name does not resolve

If you have a message which contain '_elasticsearch: Name does not resolve_', it means that Datashare can't make Elastic Search, its search engine, work. 

In that case, you need to **re-open Datashare**: ****here are the instructions for [Mac](https://icij.gitbook.io/datashare/mac/open-datashare-on-mac), [Windows](https://icij.gitbook.io/datashare/windows/open-datashare-on-windows) or [Linux](https://icij.gitbook.io/datashare/linux/open-datashare-on-linux). 

Example of a message regarding a problem with ElasticSearch:

_SearchException: query='lovelace' message='org.icij.datashare.batch.SearchException: java.io.IOException: elasticsearch: Name does not resolve'_
