9. Datashare is now installed as well as another tool that makes it work, called **Docker Desktop**. You can find Docker Desktop on your Mac menu bar, on the top right of your computer's screen. Its icon is a little whale! It contains components necessary for Datashare to work. **Docker Desktop will run automatically when you use Datashare**. 

If you don't see the docker whale, please **continue to open with Datashare**.

If Docker Desktop offers to log in with Docker ID, **do NOT log in and** **close this window**:
