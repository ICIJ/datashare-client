**Keep this Terminal window open as long as you use Datashare.**

3. **Datashare should now automatically open in your default internet browser.**  
  
If it doesnâ€™t, please type 'localhost:8080' in your browser.  
  
Datashare **runs in your internet browser**, even when it works offline with no internet connection. \(See FAQ: [Can I use Datashare with no internet connection?](https://icij.gitbook.io/datashare/faq-general/can-i-use-datashare-with-no-internet-connection)\)
