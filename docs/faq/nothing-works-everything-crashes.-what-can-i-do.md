# Nothing works, everything crashes. What can I do?

If Datashare crashes, please try to **restart Docker Desktop.**

On **Mac:** 

* Click the Docker Desktop icon on the top menu bar. The following drop-down menu appears:

* Click '**Restart'**.
* As long as the icon's little points move, it means that Docker Desktop is still restarting.
* Once these points stopped moving, either Datashare restarted automatically or you can restart Datashare manually \(see '[Open Datashare](https://icij.gitbook.io/datashare/mac/open-datashare-on-mac)'\).

On **Windows**, 

* Right-click the Docker Desktop icon \(a little whale\) on the bottom menu bar.

* Click '**Restart'** again.

* Wait for Docker Desktop to restart.

* When it says '**Docker Desktop is running'**, either Datashare restarted automatically or you can restart Datashare manually \(see '[Open Datashare](https://icij.gitbook.io/datashare/windows/open-datashare-on-windows)'\).

On **Linux**, please execute: `sudo service docker restart`
