# What if tasks are 'running' but not completing?

You started tasks, and they are running as you can see on '[http://localhost:8080/\#/indexing](http://localhost:8080/#/indexing)' but they are not completing.

There are two possible causes:  


* If you see a progress of **less than 100%**, **please wait.**

   ****

* If the progress is **100%**, an error has occurred, and the tasks failed to complete, which may be caused by various reasons. If you're an advanced user, you can create an issue on [Datashare Github](https://github.com/ICIJ/datashare/issues) with the application logs.
