Please beware that Datashare show named entities by default. **This can overwrite some original text with wrong named entities.** It is thus important to **always verify original text** by deactivating named entity overwriting. To do so, please: 

* **Turn off** the toggle button ‘**Show named entities**’ and read the extracted text
* Check the ‘**Preview’** of original document if available
* Check the original document at its original location or by clicking the pink button ‘**Download**’



**Search for terms within this document:**

* Press **Command\(⌘\) + F** \(on Mac\) or **Control + F** \(on Windows and Linux\) or click on the search bar above your Extracted Text
* Type what you search for
* Press **ENTER** to go from one occurrence to the **next** one
* Presse **SHIFT + ENTER** to go from one occurrence to the **previous** one
